# timesheets
an attempt to make time tracking less painless

## Goals

- reduce time spent in Jira (currently using Tempo for time tracking)
- quickly access recent Jira tickets (which I need to log time against)
- provide a tool that helps others log time more effectively
- the tool should be useful even without Jira/Tempo integration
- the tool should be fast and never clunky
